This repository contains the materials for the _"advanced" Unix system programming in C_ class that used to be taught at the [Mathematical-physical faculty of the Charles university in Prague](https://www.mff.cuni.cz).

The materials are very much in progress. Unless we ever get to tech the class again (depends largely on the demand), they will stay in this shape.
