This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work
non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations
under the identical terms. Others can download and redistribute your work just
like the by-nc-nd license, but they can also translate, make remixes, and
produce new stories based on your work. All new work based on yours will carry
the same license, so any derivatives will also be non-commercial in nature.

Note: The Commons Deed is not a license. It is simply a handy reference
      for understanding the Legal Code (the full license) it is a
      human-readable expression of some of its key terms. Think of it as
      the user-friendly interface to the Legal Code beneath. This Deed itself
      has no legal value, and its contents do not appear in the actual license.
